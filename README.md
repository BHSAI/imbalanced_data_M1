# Enhancing Classification of Imbalanced Muscarinic Receptor M1 Datasets Using Transfer Learning and Generative AI Techniques

 
![Summary](Data/summary.png)

## Abstract
Imbalanced data are a commonly encountered problem when building classification models from public databases. Typically, the databases contain a large fraction of active compounds as inactives are rarely reported in the literature. This imbalance can lead to skewed models with a high rate of false positives, making them unsuitable for virtual screening of chemical databases. Using the muscarinic receptor M1 as a case study, we investigated three strategies to balance public bioactivity datasets: 1) carefully analyzing the bioactivity distribution and selecting an appropriate decision boundary, 2) generating inactive compounds using a recurrent neural network trained on the source data, and 3) transfer learning, i.e., building a classification model on a larger corpus of related data and transferring the parameters. We found that these approaches reduced misclassification of the inactive class, increasing the specificity from 0.37 to 0.68 for a scaffold-split-generated test set and from 0.07 to 0.60 for a public high-throughput screening test set. Thus, we not only developed a robust classification model to screen chemicals against M1, but also developed a general framework for treating imbalanced data that can be translated across other targets, allowing us to build better classification models.

## Contents
This repository contains the data, scripts, and models used in this study. They are sorted into 3 major sections:
  +	Data folder containing all the data used in this study. It is divided into 4 sub-sections.
    - Input: Contains the M1 bioactivities from ChEMBL and BindingDB, a combined public dataset and the list of compounds generated by recurrent neural network (RNN)
    - Training: Contains different files used for training the model. Deep neural network (DNN) models uses Morgan fingerprints for training, and are labelled as “_FP”
    - Test: Contains the scaffold-split based, high-throughput screening (HTS) and DrugBank datasets. Same naming conventions are followed as in Training
    - Results: Contains a sample results file generated from the scripts

  +	Scripts folder containing three python scripts that can be run with python script.py
    -	curate_data.py that combines data from public databases and create the training and scaffold-split-based test sets
    -	add_RNN.py that augments the RNN generated inactives with the training set
    -	pred_sklearn.py that runs the NB, RF and XG models
    -	pred_dnn_w_transfer_learning.py that runs the regular DNN along with transfer learning

+	Model folder containing the Naïve Bayes, Random forest, XGBoost and the various DNN models

## Setting up the anaconda environment
To run the python script, you will first need Anaconda installed. From an Anaconda prompt, set up a new environment using the following commands:

conda create -n imbalanced_m1 python=3.9

conda activate imbalanced_m1

Next, navigate to this repository's folder and enter the following command to install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
